#These are the commands issued and some rationale behind the LasI orthologue tree

Firstly, I downloaded all orthologous sequences identified by [OrthoDB]([https://www.orthodb.org/?query=208964_0:0003c9])
from Gammaproteobacteria. This search yielded 709 genes across 607 species. To exclude potential false-positive hits/not well charactarized proteins, only sequences annotated as having the following InterPro domains were chosen:
  - IPR001690: Autoinducer synthase
  - IPR016181: Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase
  - IPR018311: Autoinducer synthesis, conserved site
